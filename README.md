# Code Club sessions teaching Python for beginners

We started our post-pandemic Code Club sessions in the new Wokingham library in January 2023, and our Python sessions began with some basic teaching on coding for people who had never used Python before.

This page includes some links to code and documents used during these beginner sessions.

This session roughly followed the sequence in this document, which has more explanation:

### Rules for naming your Python variables:
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _ )
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character - never a number
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- We canâ€™t use reserved keywords as a variable name
- We should avoid using names of Python functions, eg print, input, str

To find the list of reserved keywords go to the trinket Python console [trinket.io/console](https://trinket.io/console)

and type (you don't have to type the >>>):

```python
>>> import keyword
>>> keyword.kwlist
```
