# Code Club sessions teaching Python for beginners

We started our post-pandemic Code Club sessions in the new Wokingham library in January 2023, and our Python sessions began with some basic teaching on coding for people who had never used Python before.

This page includes some links to code and documents used during these beginner sessions.
